                      Bassel Khartabil (Arabic: خرطبيل باسل‎)  also known as Bassel Safadi (Arabic: صفدي باسل‎) ( born May 22, 1981 in Damascus) is a Palestinian Syrian open­source software developer. Since March 15, 2012, the one­ year anniversary of the Syrian uprising, he was

                      by the Syrian government in Damascus at Adra Prison. As of October 3, 2015, he has been transferred to an unknown location, probably to be judged by a military court. On October 7, 2015 Human Rights Watch and 30 other human rights organizations issued a letter demanding that Khartabil's whereabouts be disclosed.

                    For millennia, the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra was a vital crossroads of trade and culture.

By sharing data and encouraging its use in creative explorations we hope to promote cultural understanding.

                    With the advanced and novel application of 3D technologies used in the #NEWPALMYRA Project, Bassel Khartabil exemplifies MIT Media Lab’s tradition of human-scaled innovation. The application of technologies to the pressing issues of our world today is precisely why Bassel’s #NEWPALMYRA Project is so important - his work sets the standard for a deliberate and conscientious approach to open culture, technology, and the arts. It’s precisely the kind of work we support at MIT Media Lab, where innovations are connected locally again and again until they are truly global.

                    Perched on the Eastern Mediterranean and steeped in history, Syria has accumulated many interrelated cultures. Some flourished for a long time and radiated their influence near and far. Others, like Palmyra, shone brightly for a brief moment.  Still others inhabited small niches in the land and emerged in modern times as unique Syrian mini-cultures. All, however, contribute to the rich history of Syria and give the country an aura of vivid multiculturalism long before the term was coined.

                    Once the current violence ends, the people of Syria will need to find ways to reconnect with symbols that once united them across religious and political lines. The country’s ancient past, represented in its rich cultural heritage, is key to this. Saving Syria&#039;s past is about saving its future too.

                      Jeffrey Shaw has been a leading figure in new media art since its emergences in the 1960s to its present day technology-informed and virtualized forms. In a prolific career of widely exhibited and critically acclaimed work he has pioneered the creative use of digital media technologies in the fields of expanded cinema, virtual and augmented reality, immersive visualization environments, navigable cinematic systems and interactive narrative. Shaw is currently Endowed Chair Professor of Media Art at City University Hong Kong, and in 2015 he was awarded the Ars Electronica Golden Nica for Visionary Pioneer of Media Art.

                    Lost and found. Cultural heritage has become a subject of media art via innovative strategies of re-presentation and the re-enactment of place. Such aesthetic re-embodiments gives agency to the historical narrative in a manner that elucidates and enriches contemporaneity. The devastation of historical artifacts does not have to be the defining limit of experiential possibilities with virtual methodologies. The rich history of Palmyra is activated by artists, developers and creators who use the historical data of the ancient city to generate hypersensory experiences with multimedia platforms to make a city that represents the meeting—the rejoining—of the rich diversity of its past with our current global reality.

                      Embracing diverse media, Manal AlDowayan's work encompasses black and white
                      photography, sculpture, video, sound, neon and large-scale participatory
                      installations. Her artistic practice revolves around themes of active
                      forgetting, archives, and collective memory, with a large focus on the state
                      of Saudi women and their representation.

                      She has documented social groups like the oil men and women of Saudi Arabia
                      in her project, If I Forget You Don't Forget Me, and has addressed the
                      impact of mass media on propagating intentional erasing of identities in her
                      project Crash, highlighting the unnamed Saudi teachers dying in car crashes
                      across Saudi Arabia. Her participatory projects have attracted hundreds of
                      women to use art as a new platform to address social injustice like Tree of
                      Guardians, Esmi-My Name, and Suspended Together.

                      In 2014 she was a recipient of a research Fellowship from NYU AD and was

                      Florida. Manal has shown her work in Prospect 3 New Orleans - The American
                      Biennale (2014/15), in collateral shows at the Venice Biennale (2009/11),
                      and at Museums around the world like Gawngju Museum in South Korea,
                      Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark, The Victoria and Albert Museum in
                      UK, and Mathaf Museum of Modern Arab Art in Qatar. Her art works are part of
