              <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>#NEWPALMYRA</b> is:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A <b>Digital Archaeology</b> project, collecting data from international partners, analyzing it, creating a reconstruction of Palmyra in virtual space, and sharing the models and data in the public domain.
