    <h4><strong>#NEWPALMYRA Releases Arch of Triumph Virtual Model for 3D Printers </strong></h4>

    <p>San Francisco, CA, Jan 15, 2015 — Today, the #NEWPALMYRA project publicly released the recreated Syrian cultural heritage site, the Arch of Triumph. #NEWPALMYRA, an online community platform and data repository dedicated to the capture, preservation, sharing, and creative reuse of data about the ancient city of Palmyra, released the second model in the project’s larger plan to rebuild the ISIS destroyed UNESCO World Heritage Site in war-torn Syria. </p>

  <p>“The Arch of Triumph is a symbol of the indestructible cultural spirit of Syria,” said #NEWPALMYRA Interim Director, Barry Threw. “The free sharing of this symbol ensures that the memory embodied in it can never truly be destroyed. It is a message to the world that cultural heritage is bigger than religious ideology, political boundaries, or war, and is part of the collective human experience shared by everyone on Earth.”</p>

  <p>#NEWPALMYRA open sourced the Arch of Triumph, referred to online as #ARCHOFTRIUMPH, as a free culture project by issuing an open call for researchers, developers, and artists to contribute data, 3D modeling skills, and creative projects using the free and open model available online at NEWPALMYRA.org. The model data is released into the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero 1.0 license.</p>

  <p>Creative Commons CEO, Ryan Merkley stated, “We're proud to see the release of the Arch of Triumph. This act not only allows sharing freely with the world, it also preserves and digitally protects our cultural heritage. #NEWPALMYRA will live on for everyone as part of the Commons.”</p>

  <p>The #NEWPALMYRA project also announced that on Friday, January 22, the open model will be 3D Printed globally by its community of affiliates, to celebrate the release. The documentation of the printing from around the world will be shared online, tagged #ARCHOFTRIUMPH. The results will be displayed at an art exhibition titled, Protocultural Taipei “New Causes for the Old”, at the Taipei Contemporary Art Center, with an opening on Saturday, January 23 and show running until January 31, 2016.</p>

  <p>“We call on all 3D printmakers around the world to participate in a mass global effort to synthesize the Arch of Triumph, by downloading the free and open source model, printing it, and documenting the object publicly online”, said Protocultural Taipei organizer, Christopher Adams. “The creative results will be exhibited along with other artworks celebrating cultural replenishment at the Taipei Contemporary Art Center.”</p>
