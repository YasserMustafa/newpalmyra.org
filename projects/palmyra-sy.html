	<p>Palmyra: An oasis in the Syrian desert, north-east of Damascus, Palmyra contains the monumental ruins of a great city that was one of the most important cultural centers of the ancient world. From the 1st to the 2nd century, the art and architecture of Palmyra, standing at the crossroads of several civilizations, married Graeco-Roman techniques with local traditions and Persian influences.</p> 

	<p>I designed and developed this interactive journey during the school of fine arts workshop in Palmyra. The project was featured later during the city design show, and during my final graduation ceremony.</p>
