  <p>I'm trying to create a 3D reconstruction of the ruins of Palmyra using photogrammetry, a technique in which a computer program uses photos of structures/objects from different angles to create a 3D representation.</p>

  <p>I need people's unaltered digital photos (as they will have the raw information embedded, such as shutter speed and aperture), so that the software can create an accurate model. Also the more photos = the more angles covered and the better the model.</p>

  <p>Once there are enough photos for the model it will be made publicly available.</p>
