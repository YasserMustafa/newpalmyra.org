  <p><a href="http://protocultural.org/">Protocultural</a> is a series of events to gather scientists, artists and geeks to develop new forms of artistic and technological expressions based on their digital practices.</p>

  <p>Protocultural is a moving space to prototype a continuation of thousands of years of human history expressed in all existing art forms.</p>

  <p>Protocultural considers computer coding as a continuation of human writing history. It takes advantage of all intellectual technologies to push forward the borders of emotions, literacy and understanding of life.</p>

  <p>Protocultural is an attempt to span art, science, and technology with brains, bare hands and the help of some technology.</p>
